# bbc articles
# concept: dictionary and files

'''
You will be given a list of bbc files as list and a searh_key

Build a dictionary with word as keys and value as a list of bbc file names in which the word is present.

for example if "people" is passed as search key it should be able to return a list of filenames like ["bb1.txt", "bb2.txt", "bbc4.txt"] because "people" word is present in all the listed files.

Now you can imagine that your dictionary should contain each word as key and values should be a list of filenames in which it exists
